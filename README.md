# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This code loads the relevant pieces of the Samsung Data into objects in R, then tidies each piece of data and combines them into a single
data frame called "mydata". 
As requested per the project instructions "mydata" only has columns that are measurements on mean and standard deviation of each v
variable.
Lines 85-1306 are a very long way of refining the data from "mydata" into another data frame "finaldf" that has the mean of each column for each
subject and each activity for each subject.
I got very close to writing a for loop to be more efficient for creating "finaldf" but for the sake of submitting on time, I wrote it out the hard way. Any suggestions are more than welcome.
