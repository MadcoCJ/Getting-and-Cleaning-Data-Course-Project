# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This code loads the relevant pieces of the Samsung Data into objects in R, then tidies each piece of data and combines them into a single
data frame called "mydata". 
As requested per the project instructions "mydata" only has columns that are measurements on mean and standard deviation of each v
variable.
Lines 85-1306 are a very long way of refining the data from "mydata" into another data frame that has the mean of each column for each
subject and each activity for each subject.
